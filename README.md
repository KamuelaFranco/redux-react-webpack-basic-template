# Redux + React Basic Template
## USAGE:
```
npm install
npm start
open localhost:3000
```

This is the end result of stripping out my last Redux project. I'm making no claims on the practices here and whether or not they should be considered "best" for most applications. I am looking for feedback. I find this to be a good balance between utility and ease of understanding.

Includes a jsconfig.json for Visual Studio Code that you can confidently throw away if you're not using that editor.
