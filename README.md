# Redux + React Basic Template
## USAGE:
```
npm i && npm start
open localhost:8080
```

## TODO:
  Implement new version of Webpack when it is released to default dead code elimination.
  Fully test the application and give it a few more defaults.
  Possibly turn it into a generator.

This has been updated to include the latest version of Babel, Immutable.js, React, Redux, and Mocha, Expect, and React Add-ons for testing. Also includes common loaders for CSS and JSON.

This is the end result of stripping out my last Redux project. I'm making no claims on the practices here and whether or not they should be considered "best" for most applications. I am looking for feedback. I find this to be a good balance between utility and ease of understanding.
